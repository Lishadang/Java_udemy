OOP Basics
OOp is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'object

OOP vs Functional Programming
OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around the objects, rather than functions
Modularity,Scalability,Lower cost of development,security & reliability

OOP is a software design approach in which concept of 'object' occupies the first place

Array is a object,data connection is object
Imagine a car doors ,wheels,body,engine,color.
Behavior:
Turn on headlights,start engine,turn right,turn left
Object is a virtual entity with specific list of properties which can distingish it from manipulating behavior
data+behavior->object

Class is a template for object car class have diff properties

OOP principles
Inheritance ->sports car same wheels share oproperties and behavior 
Encapsulation ->methods+variables button,access modifiers private public protected,default
Polymorphism ->one interface-multiple implementation engine start override behavior method overriding
Abstraction ->car & plane
